# Facial Expression Analysis of group photo 
## (The 3rd International Conference on Next Generation Computing(ICNGC2017b))

## Matlab

#This code is implemented in MATLAB. Soon i will upload the python script in the following weeks. 

I have uploaded the images directries for each class with few images. 

Run hogFeatures.m //for features collection. Make sure to change path of directries in this file. After completion, save the model as .mat file.

Run Loadmodel.m //for testing.

# Notice (Contact Me)

The changes are made according to latest development in frameworks (tensorflow, keras, etc)
Next, We are really sorry to have the raw code, but to ensure the availability of an easy and understandable code we need some time. Feel free to contact me at fath3797@gmail.com if you have any queries or you will be okay with raw format code. Thanks
